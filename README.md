This project was implemented using the Python 3.9 interpreter and the open source package conda.

In order to run it, you must first install the requirements from the requirements.txt file, using the command:
``pip install -r requirements.txt``

There are some packages that are not included in this file, like the graphviz, it can be installed using the command:
``conda install graphviz python-graphviz``

Once the requirements are installed, you need to execute the first strategy, called: setup. In case that you don't know how to execute it, you can use the help strategy. Entering the arguments: 
``--help``

The setup strategy will install all the folders and files needed to execute the other strategies.

Then you need to clone the repository stored at the URL https://github.com/marGaliana/SignLanguageProcessingDataset.git. it's very important to clone it in the Assets/Dataset/Images path. These folders will be created after the setup strategy has been executed. This respository contains the samples from each dataset used.
